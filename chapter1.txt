Note: code chapter1.txt lets u go into a file

      "git init" allows u to initalize a git repository inside the folder you're currently in.
      "ls -a" this allows you to see all files(including hidden ones) inside the folder.
      "git status" shows the untracked files that are within ur working directory but not yet in the staging area
